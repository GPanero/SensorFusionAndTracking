# SensorFusionAndTracking
This is the project for the Udacity Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program : Sensor Fusion and Tracking.  In this project, LiDAR and camera and track vehicles over time. will be fused, object detection using 3D point clouds will be performed and an extended Kalman filter will be applied for sensor fusion and tracking.
